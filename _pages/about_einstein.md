I'm a research engineer at Stability AI based out of London. I'm part of the [Code.AI Team](https://www.code.ai) at Stability AI, I predominantly work on large-scale pretraining of code models. During my time at Stability AI, I've been working on [Stable Code suite of models](https://huggingface.co/collections/stabilityai/stablecode-64f9dfb4ebc8a1be0a3f7650). I was also one of the core members of [Code.AI](https://code.ai), a community of researchers and engineers working on Code Intelligence and Machine Learning aided Code Completion systems. I was a major contributor to one of the first open source Code Language Model <a href="https://huggingface.co/CodedotAI">Code Clippy</a>.
